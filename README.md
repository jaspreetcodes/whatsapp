# Whatsapp Clone

This is an individual project created by me from my two different GitHub accounts: jaspreetcodes and jaspreetchicmic.
The latest correct code is present in the: sidebarLastMessage branch.
- This web app allows users to register with verified emails, bypassing WhatsApp's contact list requirement. As it is developed individually within budget constraints, it can handle a limited number of user requests of 40,000 per day. 
- However, it ensures secure user authorization and offers features like one-on-one/group chats, profile updates, message notifications, and attachments, resembling WhatsApp's UI.
- Tech stack: ReactJs, Firebase, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. To open the live web app go here: https://jaspreet-chat-app.netlify.app/

## Problem Statement

WhatsApp requires users to add contacts to their phone's contact list to chat, which can be inconvenient, especially when you want to talk to someone who is not on your contact list. Moreover, it does not allow users to use email as an alternative to phone numbers for registration, which can be a problem for users who do not have a phone number or do not want to share their phone number. This web app solves this problem by allowing users to register through their verified emails and enabling them to chat with anyone who is on the app.
